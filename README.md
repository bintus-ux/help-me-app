on opening the help me app folder on vs code:

* open the terminal and input "npm start"
* the local host was set to localhost://3001 to open on that particular PORT number.
* Therefore when accessing the help me out extension, making a screen record video and clicking the stop button it redirects automatically to the localhost://3001 help me app home page site screen.
